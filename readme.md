Namaste. I am Mansi. 
I am a coder and have recently started solving the Striver's CP Sheet. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/coder_india) and on [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/code_mansi) and on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/transformers-ai/).

This repository contains the solution of all the problems that I have solved till now. I will try to explain the solution as well, as I move ahead. You can find the solutions in each code file on the top.


Credits - All thanks to Raj Vikramaditya aka [striver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajstriver/) for creating this [CP sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interview-experience/strivers-cp-sheet).
I hope I will be able to solve it all.
